### üí° My First GitHub & Python Project

This project is a major milestone for me\! It represents my first attempt at building a functional Python application and sharing it on GitHub. I've learned a lot about:

  * **Python:** Working with data structures, functions, and file handling.
  * **Streamlit:** Building interactive web applications with a simple and elegant framework.
  * **Pandas:** Efficiently reading and manipulating data from Excel files.
  * **GitHub:** Version control, creating a repository, and writing a good README.

A big thank you to the help of a large language model, which was an invaluable assistant throughout the coding process, helping me debug issues and improve the code. This project is a testament to what can be achieved with the right tools and a passion for learning.

### ü§ù Contributing & Future Improvements

This project is a work in progress and there's always room for improvement\! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Here are some ideas for future development:

  * Add a timer for the mock test.
  * Implement a dark mode toggle.
  * Allow users to save their progress or results.
  * Enhance the UI with more custom CSS.

I hope this app is useful for anyone preparing for the ASOC exam\!
